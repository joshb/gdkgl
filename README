This is just a bit of code I had written back in the GTK+ 2.0 days (sometime
in 2003) to support the use of OpenGL within GTK+ applications. I had proposed
including it with GTK+ and there was some interest, but it was decided in the
end that external libraries like gtkglext should be used instead for mixing
OpenGL with GTK+.
